# Pattern matching | Multiple versions

* More readable and maintainable
* More flexibility
* More clear and concise code

<hr>

Basic pattern matching with `is` expressions and type patterns in `switch` statements was released in legacy C#, version 7. In modern C#:

* **C# 8.0**: Added switch expressions, property patterns, tuple patterns, and positional patterns.
* **C# 9.0**: Introduced relational patterns, logical patterns (and, or, not), and parenthesized patterns.
* **C# 10.0**: Enhanced pattern matching with `constant` patterns and improvements in pattern matching in lambda expressions.
