## File-scoped types

### File-scoped namespaces | C# 10

* Remove unnecessary code
* Improve readability
* One class per file is a common pattern in C#
* Caveat: Only one file-scoped namespace per file

### File-scoped modifier | C# 11

* Scope a class or type to a file 
* Improve readability
* Another option for managing types
* Can reuse the same type names in other files
