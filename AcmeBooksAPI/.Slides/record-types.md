# Record types

Records are a way to make an entire object immutable as opposed to individual properties that are found in init-only properties.

* Enhanced readability with nominal or positional syntax
* Value type semantics in a reference type (e.g, comparisons)
* Built-in capability to encapsulate data
* Immutability
* More flexibility
